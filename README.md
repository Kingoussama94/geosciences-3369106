This repository contains tutorials and code for generating and inverting synthetic landslide and cavity models using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). It includes four scripts, covering two models—one for landslides and another for cavities—implemented using both BERT and PyGIMLi.  

ERT is a valuable geophysical method for landslide monitoring and subsurface cavity detection, allowing researchers to simulate various geological conditions and optimize detection techniques. Relying solely on field examples from previous studies can be inefficient, as subsurface and surface characteristics vary significantly between sites, affecting the effectiveness of detection methods. While physical and geotechnical testing, including core drilling, can provide detailed site information, these approaches are often impractical or cost-prohibitive for every scenario. Synthetic modeling, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective way to explore different site conditions and subsurface structures, enhancing our understanding of ERT's capabilities in diverse geological settings.
